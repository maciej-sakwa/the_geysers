# The Geysers

## 1. Overview
This study focuses on analysis of seismic activity in The Geysers region in California, USA. 

In this research activity we wanted to study the presence of the earthquaqe frequency in the area and examine their spatial and time dependence. 
Our hypothesis was that these earthquakes are triggered by a composition of processes (or factors) and that their spatial and time density depends on the impacts of these factors. In this activity we try to identify those factors by means of unsupervised learning methods.

## 2. Workflow and preliminary results

Starting form the original earthquake dataset (acquired courtesy of Calpine and UC Berkeley) we limitted the earthquakes to an area between 38.7 and 38.9 degree North -122.9 and -122.6 West and depths up to 14 km and period between Jan 2006 and Jun 2016. The area has been divided in a mesh of 0.025 deg x 0.025 deg x 0.25 km and the eq. density for each month of observation in each created 'node' has been found, and such a Density Time History is created. This DTH is used to study the temporal and spacial behaviur of earthquakes by defining spatial domains through clustering. In the end we used ICA to identify independent sources of earthquakes in the area.  

## 3. Results

The result of this research activity will be demonstrated here once the paper is published. 

## 4. Credits 

This research activity has been conducted in cooperation with dr Mauro Palo (Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II) and prof Emanuele Carlo Giovanni Ogliari (Politecnico di Milano) who both provided necessary scientific background and feedback on the development of the work.
