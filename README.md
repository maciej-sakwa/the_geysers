# The Geysers

## 1. Overview
This study focuses on analysis of seismic activity in The Geysers region in California, USA. 

In this research activity we wanted to study the presence of the earthquaqe frequency in the area and examine their spatial and time dependence. 
Our hypothesis was that these earthquakes are triggered by a composition of processes (or factors) and that their spatial and time density depends on the impacts of these factors. In this activity we try to identify those factors by means of unsupervised learning methods.
