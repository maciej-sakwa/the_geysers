# The Geysers

## 1. Overview
This study focuses on analysis of seismic activity in The Geysers region in California, USA. 
In this research activity we want to study the presence of the earthquaqe frequency in the area and examine their spatial and time dependence. 
Our hypothesis is that these earthquakes are triggered by a composition of processes (or factors) and that their spatial and time density depends on the impacts of these factors. In this activity we want to extract and study these processes by means of PCA.
